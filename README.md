# EX-01-Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is **odd** or **not anodd** using `nested if..else.` statements.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable `a`
3. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if `a % 2 == 1`.
   - If true, print `"Odd number"`.
   - Else, print `"Not an Odd number"`.
4. End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```

Register.no:212224100063
a=int(input())
if a%2==1:
    if a>=25:
        print(f"{a} is an Odd number")
        print(f"{a} is greater than or equal to 25")
    else:
        print(f"{a} is an Odd number")
        print(f"{a} is lesser than 25")
else:
    print(f"{a} is NOT an Odd number")

## Result
Thus program to check whether the given number is **odd** or **not anodd** using `nested if..else.` statements has been executed successfully.


# Ex-02-Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
```

Register.no:212224100063

a= (0 == True)
b= (False== False)
c= True + True
d= False + 9
print('a is','False')
print('b is','True')
print('c: 2')
print('d: 9')
```

## Result
Thus Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False` has executed successfully.


# Ex-03-Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'A'` and `'O'` using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Print the character `'A'`.
2. Print the character `'O'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
Developed by:YAZHINI R R
Register.no:212224100063
a=input()
o=input()
print(a)
print(o)
```

## Result
Thus the program that prints the characters `'A'` and `'O'` using character literals has been executed successfully.


# ðŸ§®  Ex-04-Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a python program to Add  two complex  numbers.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set a variable `c1` to the result of the expression `12+3j`.
2. Set a variable `c2` to the result of the expression `4+5j`.
3. print `(c1+c2)`.

## ðŸ’» Program
```
Developed by:YAZHINI R R
Register.no:212224100063
c1=12+3j
c2=4+5j
print(c1+c2)
```
